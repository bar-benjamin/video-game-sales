    "# Objective\n",
    "In this <b>project</b> I will deal only with <b>data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis and statistical data analysis</b>, where the objective is to understand how the data is distributed and generate insight for future decision-making in order to identify patterns that determine whether a game succeeds or not. This will allow companies to spot potential top games and plan advertising campaigns, this analysis aims to explore as much as possible the data in a simple, intuitive and informative way. The data used in this project contains information only from <b>1980</b> to <b>2016</b>. Below is a sketch of all the stages made in these notebooks, following a logical and intuitive sequence to facilitate the understanding of the data.\n",
